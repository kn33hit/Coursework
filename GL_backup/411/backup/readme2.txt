THE RTL VERSION README

FOR INSTRUCTOR
--------------------------------
- Disregard the #.csv# file if it is pulled from the repo 
- The R1 and R2 registers that lie on the cycle boundary after instruction 
  decode are A and B respectively in the RTL file. 
- Just like A and B. The X, IR, IMM registers mentioned in the RTL are also 
  the cycle boundary registers. So, when saying A, B, X, IR, IMM in rtl, 
  it means that the values being used or assigned are placeholders 
  for mentioning these registers.



FOR GROUP 
---------------------------------
Neh: Hey. Most of the code seems copy and paste. 
Currently I'm going to stop doing rtl and work on the time for the datapath. 
If anyone could check and make sure if everything is okay in the RTL file, it would be great.
