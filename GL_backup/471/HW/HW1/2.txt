PART II
- What can AI do right now?
-> The field of AI is evolving so fast you could say that the growth is almost exponential. But if we were to mention some of the things, they would be: Being able to speak in other language , but in the same voice (TED talk example); Being able to recognize cancer cells in the body using images of the cells in the body (TED talk video), The bot created to carry bags, arms and food for army on any kind of terrain. (several videos about it online). These are some of the examples showing how far the field has expanded in the last decade from just having cleverest, that may talk like humans.

There are thousands of things that Artificial Intelligence would come into play and make human life much more easier. First of, I would like to mention things that I like: sports. That about sums it up. I prefer playing the sport, rather than watching. So I prefer to make something that can be useful when I’m outside playing the sport. Also, to mention all the sports I do play: cricket, football, and basketball. There are others but I prefer these more than any other. Something that I play the most, and would like to have a project related to it is cricket. However, as football is a more popular sport in the states, I wouldn’t mind doing something related to that field as well. There can be many more aspects that AI can be used to help us. One of the things is making a ref that make the correct calls. Using images that can be recorded, if a certain action is made in front of the ref, it can look back into its last 10-20 seconds of footage to recognize and tell what happened in mere milliseconds and make the correct call right away, which can sometimes be really tough for humans to do, as we have noticed that in some the of the games that are blown by refs. Also, it can be helpful to have AI refs while playing a backyard sport. It would feel just like a real game. One of the ideas I have for cricket is the lbw call, which is judged by the umpire. It is a type of out used, which is appealed by the bowling team, and depending on a few variables the umpire judges the batsmen out or not out. It would be really cool to make a robot that would be able to do the same task with a few other tasks to referee the game of cricket. It can also be very helpful to me, as I play this sport very very often. However, the resources for this kind of project would be a little difficult to obtain. It is still a possibility and I would love to do something like this.
