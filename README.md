# Coursework

Under this folder is all of the work compiled over the last 4 years of my life(2013-2016). Most of it is coursework projects at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Majoring in Computer Science has allowed me to develop all these projects in various languages: C, C++, Python, PHP, HTML, Perl, and many many more. You may use snippets or entire projects if they seem to help you out. There will be a few files that will missing as they belong to other developers who have helped me or I was required to use those tools to finish my work. So, if the code is copied and not working that will most likely be the reason. I will try my best to review and update the files so it is more user-friendly and bug-free. Happy coding! :)
