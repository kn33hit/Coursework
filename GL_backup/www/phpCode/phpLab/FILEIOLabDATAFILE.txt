The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the San Francisco Bay area and the Los Alamos
 National Laboratory in New Mexico are competing to design the nation's first new nuclear 
bomb in two decades. Scientists at both facilities are working around the clock on plans 
that will be presented to the Nuclear Weapons Council, a federal panel that oversees the 
nation's nuclear weapons. The council will choose a winner later this year. "I have had 
people working nights and weekends," said Joseph Martz, the head of the Los Alamos design 
team. "I have to tell them to go home. I can't keep them out of the office." Congress 
approved the new bomb, known as the reliable replacement warhead, with bipartisan support 
in 2005 as part of a defense spending bill. The weapon would, by law, have the same 
explosive power as existing warheads. Proponents of the project say the U.S. would lose 
its so-called "strategic deterrent" unless it replaces its aging arsenal of about 6,000 
bombs, which will become potentially unreliable within 15 years. A new, more reliable 
weapon, they say, would help the nation reduce its stockpile. Critics say the project could 
trigger a new arms race with Russia and China, and undercut arguments that countries such as
 Iran and North Korea must stop their nuclear programs. The United States and Russia signed
 a treaty in 2002 calling for the countries to each cut nuclear inventories to between 1,700
 and 2,200 warheads by 2012.
