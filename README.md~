# Coursework

Under this folder is all of the work accrued over tha last 4 years(2013-2016). Most of it is coursework requirement, at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Majoring in Computer Science has allowed me to develop all these projects in various languages: C, C++, Python, PHP, HTML, Perl, and many many more. You may use snippets or entire projects if they seem to help you out. There will be a few files that will missing as they belong to other developers who have helped me or I was required to use those tools to finish my work.
