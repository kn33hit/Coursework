1. i) I expected the clever bot to be more straight forward and updated. However, I felt like I was talking to a goof ball who has not been updated for 2 years. 
ii) The amount go time it takes to respond back. Sometimes it took the 10 seconds for it to decide when I asked for the simplest of things. And sometimes it responded back in half a second on a more complicated statement. 
2. i) It can be more annoying than I thought, and IT IS NOT UP-TO-DATE. I asked the date ad it said it was like September 2013. 
ii) It likes insulting people as a a scrip to change the topic because it couldn’t understand what the user was really asking. Its annoying but a nifty little touch to overcome unrecognizable responses from the user. 
3. That’s a tough question. There are many variable that come into play: What kind of character is being tested, Are we just talking about the intelligence or a character of a person. There are many more things that can be brought up, but if just asked vaguely that if I would pass the bot as a person, then yes I would pass the bot as a person. But I would only give a ‘C.’ So, as they say that C’s get degrees, but not jobs.
